# Welcome to the Time series Integrated Knoweledge Engine  
![TESS Sketch](images/tess-icon.png)

This space is intended for astronomical researchers who use data from the NASA Kepler and TESS missions. It is a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) instance running on AWS and is installed with python software frequently used to analyze these data. It enables users to preview and make measurements against these data sets without needing to first download the data. It also contains educational tutorials, a directory to share data will collaborators and a cloud-based TESScut service.  

This platform is pre-loaded with python software packages and Jupyter notebook tutorials that teach how to do research with the TESS and Kepler Data (see the directory `notebooks/` on the left). We use git to pull new and updated notebooks into this instance, so if you decide to alter these notebooks for your own purposes (and we hope that you do), you should first make a copy for yourself into your own directory. 

The platform includes a folder called `public/` which is publicly accessible by all users of this platform. You can use this to easily share data or code with collaborators.

If something is not working on this platform or you see room for improvement, please open an issue on [github](), or email the MAST help desk, archive@stsci.edu. Contributions via pull request are also welcome!

New to JupyterHub, take this [quick tour](./tike-tour.md).

## A Few Starting Points

**[Learn Mission Data](./learn-data-skills.md)** Start here if you are new to TESS or Kepler and are trying to learn the best way to work with catalogs, retrieve light curves, and manipulate time series data.

**[Harness the Power of the Cloud](./cloud-computing.md)** These tutorials are for those wanting to learn more about how you can fully utilize this cloud computing environment with tools like S3 buckets and Dask.

**[Science Examples](./science-examples.md)** Work flows of simple science examples that make use of MAST data and the AWS environment. Use these to see what kind of research others have done with time series data.

**[Data/Meta-Data Tools](./quick-visualizations.md)** If you are more interested in browsing the MAST data holdings and/or quickly viewing the quality of the data that is available, start here. You may use this code as a starting point to customize your own scripts to perform these kinds of tasks.
