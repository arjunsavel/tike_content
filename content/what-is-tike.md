# What is TIKE?


TIKE stands for the Time series Integrated Knowledge Engine.

TIKE uses a web-based platform, called [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), which enables users to run Python Notebooks and other software remotely in a web browser without needing to install anything on your local computer.  Notebooks are a convenient way of packaging code, its outputs, and visualizations.

## Who is TIKE for?

This platform is intended for astronomical researchers who use data products from the NASA Kepler and TESS missions in the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). 

Frequently used Python packages and graphical tools are available, which enable users to preview and make measurements against these data products without needing to download anything.

There are educational tutorials available that demonstrate how to do research with the TESS and Kepler data.  We use git to pull new and updated Notebooks into your user environment, so if you decide to alter these notebooks for your own purposes (and we hope that you do), you should first make a copy for yourself into your own directory.

## A Few Starting Points

**[Learn About Mission Data](learn-data-skills.md)** - Start here if you are new to TESS or Kepler and are trying to learn the best way to work with catalogs, retrieve light curves, and manipulate time series data.

**[Harness the Power of the Cloud](cloud-computing.md)** - These tutorials are for those wanting to learn more about how you can fully utilize this cloud computing environment with tools like S3 buckets and Dask.

**[Science Examples](science-examples.md)** - Examples of simple science work flows that make use of MAST data and the AWS environment. Use these to see what kind of research others have done with time series data.

**[Data/Meta-Data Tools](quick-visualizations.md)** - If you are more interested in browsing the MAST data holdings and/or quickly viewing the quality of the data that is available, start here. You may use this code as a starting point to customize your own scripts to perform these kinds of tasks.
