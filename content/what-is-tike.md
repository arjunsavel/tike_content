# What is TIKE?


TIKE stands for the Time series Integrated Knowledge Engine.

TIKE uses a web-based platform, called [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), which enables users to run Python Notebooks and other software remotely in a web browser without needing to install anything on your local computer.  Notebooks are a convenient way of packaging code, its outputs, and visualizations.

## Who is TIKE for?

This platform is intended for astronomical researchers who use data products from the NASA Kepler and TESS missions in the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). 

Frequently used Python packages and graphical tools are available, which enable users to preview and make measurements against these data products without needing to download anything.

There are educational tutorials available that demonstrate how to do research with the TESS and Kepler data.  We use git to pull new and updated Notebooks into your user environment, so if you decide to alter these notebooks for your own purposes (and we hope that you do), you should first make a copy for yourself into your own directory.
