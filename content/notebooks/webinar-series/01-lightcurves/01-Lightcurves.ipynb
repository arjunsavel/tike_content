    "### What is a transit? \n",
    "A transit occurs when a planet passes between a star and an observer. Transits reveal an exoplanet, not because we directly observe it from many light-years away, but because the planet passing in front of its host star slightly dims its light; we see the planet's \"shadow\". The dimming is most obvious in light curves: graphs showing the intensity of light over time. \n",
