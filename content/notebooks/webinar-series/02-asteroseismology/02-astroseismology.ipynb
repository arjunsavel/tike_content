    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Exoplanetary science is one of the newest and most rapidly growing fields of astrophysics, as people try to find and characterize planets beyond our solar system. One of the most common ways to detect the existence of an exoplanet is via the resulting, periodic dip in the light curve of its star as the planet passes in front. However, there are some other periodic signals that affect light curves that can appear similar to and could be mistaken for an exoplanet transit, such as transiting binaries. We'll take a look at both of these cases and how to properly interpret those signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook assumes some familiarity with [binary stars](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/astrophysics/binary_intro.html), [exoplanets and their transits](https://avanderburg.github.io/tutorial/tutorial.html), and [light curves](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/timing1.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Would a Binary System Light Curve Look Similar to an Exoplanet Transit?\n",
    "There are several non-planetary sources, such as binary stars or variable stars (cepheids, RR Lyrae, etc.), that periodcally change brightness, and can appear similar to an exoplanet transit in front of a star.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the light curve of a binary star and compare it to that of a transiting planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Astroseismology Diagram.png](light_curves.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary stars, by definition, orbit each other. If this orbit is aligned along the line-of-sight of the observer, periodic dimming in brightness will occur; critically, this can resemble an exoplanet transit. This resemblance between binary star eclipses and exoplanet transits is particularly strong when the two binary stars are of similar size and brightness, as then the 'dips' will be closer in size and look more like a repeated planet signal."
