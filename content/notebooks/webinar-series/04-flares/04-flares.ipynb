    "## Introduction\n",
    "Stars rotate. This feature is inherently linked to stellar formation — the molecular clouds from which stars form need only very slightly rotate, and conservation of angular momentum makes sure that the final, formed star rotates, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation rate of a star tell us about its evolution, magnetic fields, etc. Stellar light curves (time-series photometry) offer a glimpse into the rotation rates of these bodies. The core idea is that stars are not homogeneous; rather, they can have cooler spots on their surface that rotate in and out of view. The classical picture is of a large single spot that yields a sinusoidal light curve, as an observer detects fewer photons when the spot is in view. In reality, stars are not so ideal; they may have multiple spots at once, and these spots evolve over time. But the general idea remains: the periodicity of a light curve is related to its rotation rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we expect that faster-rotating stars should exhibit more *flares* — short outbursts of energy greater than baseline levels — because flares and rotation rates should both be connected to the stellar magnetic field. Flares are generally thought to release magnetic energy in stars; in turn, under something known as \"dynamo theory,\" this magnetic energy is tied to the rotation rate of a star (e.g.,  [Moffatt 1978](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith-Moffatt/publication/229086771_The_Generation_of_Magnetic_Fields_in_Electrically_Conducting_Fluids/links/00b7d52c3bea06ba07000000/The-Generation-of-Magnetic-Fields-in-Electrically-Conducting-Fluids.pdf), [Parker 1979](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1979ApJ...234..333P), [Browning 2008](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/592397/meta), [Zhang\n",
    "et al. 2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-007-9089-0)). Loosely, we expect that faster-rotating stars should have greater flaring activity, whereas slower-rotating stars should have less flaring activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will work through the key mechanics of identifying a star’s rotation period from its TESS light curve. We will then apply this to a large population of stars to understand how rotation rates vary with flare rate across the M dwarf population. "

    "To address the our first observation - finding periodicity in the data — we need to calculate a *periodogram*. A periodogram is a mathematical estimate of how strong different periods are in a dataset. Under the hood, many periodograms are fundamentally related to <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2009/explained-fourier\">Fourier Transforms</a>. Before we call the periodogram function we'll be using, we want to consider what a maximum period of the pulsations might be. Based on some science cases, we might be interested in stellar periodicity that is quite long. Betelgeuse, for instance, is a star that <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00287\">has quite interesting pulsations</a> on the order of 2200 days. However, we're fundamentally limited by our observing strategy based on something called the Nyquist-Shannon Theorem."

These shorter-period frequencies may be stellar oscillations or pulsations, or harmonic aliases of a single oscillation/pulsation mode. Aliases are multiples of a \"true\" periodicity that a periodogram can pick out. For instance, if we observe something with a period of 2 days, the periodogram may also note a strong periodic signals at 4 days, 6 days, etc. because the 2 day cycle also coincides with those other cycles.\n",

A more complex approach (see, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.astro.umd.edu/~jph/Stellar_Rotation.pdf\">these notes</a>) gets an extra constant factor of 2/3 for that breakup speed."

Plot the number of flares per day against the rotation rate — does the functional form of this relationship look different from the plot generated in this notebook?\n",
    "2. In Feinstein et al. 2020, the authors describe three criteria that define robust rotation rates. Implement the below, being sure to mask out harmonics before identifying the secondary peak. Do these steps change your answers? HINT: the `stella` package may include some <a href=\"https://adina.feinste.in/stella/getting_started/other_features.html\">useful functionality</a>.\n",
    "    - <i>the rotation rate must be less than 12 days</i>\n",
    "    - <i>the width of a Gaussian fit to the peak power must be less than 40% of the peak period</i>\n",
    "    - <i>the secondary peak in the power spectrum must be 4% weaker than the primary peak</i>\n",
    "3. Feinstein et al. 2020 also identified the below checks for verifying flares. Implement these, as well; does this impact the flares vs. rotation rate plot? This exercise can be performed independently of Exercise 5.\n",
    "    - <i>the amplitude of the flare must be 1.5σ > the locally detrended light curve</i>\n",
    "    - <i>the two cadences directly following the amplitude must be 1σ > the detrended light curve (i.e., at least three consecutive outlier points are considered part of a flare);</i>\n",
    "    - <i>the cadence before and after the flare amplitude must be less than the amplitude;</i>\n",
