# Cloud-optimized science tutorials

These tutorials demonstrate the many features of the TIKE science platform. Some tutorials are introductions to the platform; others are tailored to a specific science case. All are designed to get you familiar with TIKE and its potential for research.

The links on this page will only work within the TIKE platform, but you can find external links to the notebooks in GitHub here: [Cloud-Optimized Tutorials](../markdown/cloud-optimized-github.md).

**NOTE!**  In order for these notebooks to access the expected packages in TIKE, you should run them using the TESS kernel. Once you open the notebook, select it from the dropdown menu at the upper right of the notebook, or in the top JupyterLab menu (Kernel â€º Change Kernel...).
